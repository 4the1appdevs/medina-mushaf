Qur'ān files for easy development

I'm working on a real simple but purposeful Qur'ān reader. Before even developing, I was struggling to get digital scans of Masāhif — I knew there had to be some though, because apps like Quran Android use them.

I'm using the file in the root of this repo as the source, it's a vector based PDF. 

The outputs are in folders like `png-d150` — `png` being the output file format, and `d150` being the `convert` (from `imagemagick`) argument used for that output (it's density, á la DPI).

Dark outputs are labaled `-neg`

To come, inshāAllāh (ﷻ):

- negative output
